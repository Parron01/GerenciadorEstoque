-- The up migration backfills batch_id for existing records.
-- Reverting this specific backfill (i.e., setting batch_id back to NULL for those specific records)
-- is not straightforward without knowing which records were originally NULL.
-- If the batch_id column itself was added in a previous migration (e.g., 002_add_history_batch_id.up.sql),
-- the corresponding down migration (002_add_history_batch_id.down.sql) would handle dropping the column.
-- This down migration for 003_backfill_history_batch.up.sql is intentionally left simple,
-- as batch_id is now a core part of the history model.
-- No specific action to revert the data backfill itself.

SELECT 1; -- Placeholder to make the migration tool happy if it requires some SQL.
